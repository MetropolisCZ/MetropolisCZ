Hi! 👋 I'm MetropolisCZ. My real name is Tomáš Reichel. I am from Czech republic in Europe. 

I'm interested in coding in any language, but I especially love websites (HTML, PHP, JS, SQL) and C# (UWP on both mobile and desktop).

I am a proud owner of Lumia 950 and 950 XL and I actively develop apps for these in effort to revive the platform.
